A physics-based bird simulator where the birds learn how to fly using ML Agents

wing physics based on this: https://github.com/brihernandez/SimpleWings

note: the bird are very poorly made and they have the ability to just turn off their wing's aerodynamics at will, don't take this as a *actual* bird simulator, it's just a fun little ML Agents project.
