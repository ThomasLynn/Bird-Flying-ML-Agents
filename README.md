A physics-based bird simulator where the birds learn how to fly using ML Agents

wing physics based on this: https://github.com/brihernandez/SimpleWings

warning: the bird are very poorly made and they have the ability to just turn off their wings at will, don't take this as a *actual* bird simulator, it's just an ML Agents test.
